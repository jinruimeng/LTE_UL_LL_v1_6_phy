HOW TO USE THE CODE

A documentation of the code is found in the folder "documentation".

The code is provided with three demo launcher files, named "Sim_main_launcher_3D_model_*".

The simulation starts with the launcher file. 
Simulation parameters for the 3D channel model are given in the launcher file and can be changed depending on the simulated scenario. 
They inculde: 
-Basic settings
-Network geometry
-UE antenna parameters
-eNodeB antenna parameters

Specific parameters for 3D-UMa and 3D-Umi are given in load_Uma_parameters and load_Umi_parameters.
